# clicky-game
A react.js memory game

## Frameworks
The game is built with React using Bootstrap styling. State keeps track of scoring and controls some animations.

## Playing the game
Click tiles to score points. You lose if you click the same tile twice.

## Dev notes
I've updated the styling.  Still need to code in 'win' logic.
