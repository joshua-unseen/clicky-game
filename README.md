# clicky-game
A react.js memory game

## Frameworks
The game is built with React using Bootstrap styling.  State keeps track of scoring and controls some animations.

## Playing the game
Click tiles to score points.  You lose if you click the same tile twice.

## Dev notes
The logic is complete.  The design is not.  Images are currently by placeholder.com, and some of the styling is extremely basic bootstrap.
I'll fix that when I have time.
